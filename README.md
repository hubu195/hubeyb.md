I’m diving into the exciting worlds of data science and machine learning, eager to unlock insights from data and create predictive models. Currently, I’m building my portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills, while also collaborating on an open-source data visualization tool that transforms complex data into engaging visuals. When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in the elegant art of calligraphy, where I express my creativity through beautiful handwriting and decorative letters. I love exploring different styles and techniques, turning words into stunning pieces of art.
